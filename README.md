# CS50 AI Projects

This repository contains implementations of various AI projects from the CS50 AI course. Each project tackles different concepts and challenges in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

## Project 1: Degrees
- **File:** `degrees.py`
- **Description:** This program determines how many “degrees of separation” apart two actors are. It uses breadth-first search to find the shortest path between two actors by choosing a sequence of movies that connects them.
